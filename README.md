## SVG animation sandbox

Some tests I did about SVG animation. I built a gameloop using requestAnimationFrame, and then added a worker to enhance perfs.
It could be a good idea to use SMIL for simple animations (for environment objects for ex.).
There's enough SVG objects to slow down fps; Canvas animation should be more efficient on that point.
